 * The implementation of the not found local service.

 * <p>
 * All custom service methods should be put in this class. Whenever methods are added, rerun ServiceBuilder to copy their definitions into the {@link br.com.thiagomoreira.liferay.plugins.notfound.services.service.NotFoundLocalService} interface.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a local service. Methods of this service will not have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can only be accessed from within the same VM.
